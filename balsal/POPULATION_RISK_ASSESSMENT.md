# Population-Based Infrastructure Risk Assessment

## Overview

This feature integrates population data from Google Earth Engine (GEE) with OpenStreetMap (OSM) amenity data to provide comprehensive infrastructure risk assessments for urban areas.

## Key Features

### 1. Population Data Integration
- **Source**: NASA SEDAC Gridded Population of World (GPW) v4.11
- **Data Points**: Population density, total population, area coverage
- **API Endpoint**: `/api/population?bounds=west,south,east,north&year=2020`

### 2. Amenity Counting
The system counts five critical amenity types within the map bounds:
- **Hospitals**: Emergency medical care facilities
- **Clinics/Doctors**: Primary healthcare facilities  
- **Police Stations**: Law enforcement facilities
- **Fire Stations**: Emergency response facilities
- **Parks**: Recreation and green spaces

### 3. Risk Assessment Metrics

#### Optimal Thresholds (per 10,000 people)
```javascript
{
  hospital: 2.0,      // 2 hospitals per 10,000 people
  clinic: 5.0,        // 5 clinics per 10,000 people
  police: 1.5,        // 1.5 police stations per 10,000 people
  fire_station: 1.0,  // 1 fire station per 10,000 people
  park: 10.0          // 10 parks per 10,000 people
}
```

#### Risk Levels
- **üü¢ Optimal**: Above optimal threshold - excellent coverage
- **üü° Warning**: Between warning and optimal thresholds - adequate coverage
- **üî¥ Critical**: Below warning threshold - insufficient coverage

## How to Use

### 1. Navigate to a City
- Use the city selector buttons to navigate to different metropolitan areas
- Cities include: New York, Los Angeles, London, Tokyo, Singapore, etc.

### 2. Load Amenity Layers (Optional)
- Click amenity buttons to visualize different infrastructure types
- Each amenity type shows markers and service radius circles

### 3. Perform Risk Assessment
- Click the **üîç Risk Assessment** button
- The system will:
  1. Fetch population data for current map bounds
  2. Count all amenities in the area
  3. Calculate ratios per 10,000 people
  4. Generate risk assessments

### 4. Review Results
The risk assessment panel displays:
- **Population Overview**: Total population, density statistics, area
- **Amenity Coverage Analysis**: Individual risk assessments for each amenity type
- **Overall Assessment Summary**: Count of optimal/warning/critical assessments

## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow
```
Map Bounds ‚Üí Population API + OSM Overpass API ‚Üí Risk Calculation ‚Üí UI Display
```

### Key Functions

#### `fetchPopulationData(bbox: BoundingBox)`
- Calls the backend GEE service for population data
- Returns population statistics for the specified area

#### `fetchAllAmenitiesInBbox(bbox: BoundingBox)`
- Fetches all amenity types from OpenStreetMap
- Combines data from healthcare, parks, police, and fire stations

#### `calculateRiskAssessment(population: number, amenityCounts: AmenityCount)`
- Computes ratios per 10,000 people
- Assigns risk levels based on predefined thresholds
- Generates descriptive messages for each assessment

## Example Risk Assessment Output

```
üè• Healthcare Facilities
‚úÖ Hospitals: Excellent coverage with 2.3 hospitals per 10,000 people
‚ö†Ô∏è Clinics: Adequate coverage with 3.2 clinics per 10,000 people

üöí Emergency Services  
üö® Fire Stations: Insufficient coverage with only 0.3 fire stations per 10,000 people
‚úÖ Police: Excellent coverage with 1.8 police stations per 10,000 people

üå≥ Recreation
‚úÖ Parks: Excellent coverage with 12.5 parks per 10,000 people
```

## Use Cases

### Urban Planning
- Identify underserved areas for infrastructure development
- Optimize resource allocation based on population density
- Plan new facilities in areas with critical coverage gaps

### Emergency Preparedness
- Assess emergency service coverage adequacy
- Identify areas with insufficient first responder access
- Plan evacuation routes and emergency shelters

### Public Health
- Evaluate healthcare accessibility across urban areas
- Identify medical desert areas requiring intervention
- Plan public health initiatives based on coverage gaps

### Quality of Life Assessment
- Assess recreational facility availability
- Evaluate walkability and green space access
- Support livability studies and city rankings

## Limitations and Considerations

### Data Accuracy
- Population data from 2020 - may not reflect recent changes
- OSM data quality varies by location and maintenance
- Service radius assumptions may not reflect actual accessibility

### Geographic Coverage
- Works best in well-mapped urban areas
- Rural areas may have limited OSM data
- Population data resolution varies by region

### Performance
- Large areas may exceed API timeouts
- Zoom in for detailed analysis of specific neighborhoods
- Risk assessment processes multiple API calls - allow processing time

## Future Enhancements

### Additional Amenities
- Schools and educational facilities
- Public transportation stops
- Shopping centers and markets
- Community centers

### Advanced Metrics
- Travel time analysis instead of straight-line distance
- Demographic-specific needs assessment
- Economic factors integration
- Temporal analysis (business hours, seasonal variations)

### Visualization Improvements
- Heat maps for risk levels
- Interactive charts and graphs
- Comparative analysis between areas
- Export capabilities for reports
