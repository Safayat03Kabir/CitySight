# Updated Risk Assessment Thresholds Based on Urban Planning Standards

## Overview

The risk assessment thresholds have been updated to align with professional urban planning benchmarks and international standards for urban service provision. These evidence-based standards provide more realistic and actionable assessments for infrastructure planning.

## Threshold Updates

### 🏥 **Healthcare (Combined Hospitals + Clinics)**
**Previous (Separate) vs Updated (Combined) per 10,000 people:**
- **Critical**: Hospital 1.0 + Clinic 6.7 → **Healthcare 7.7** (Minimal total medical capacity)
- **Warning**: Hospital 2.0 + Clinic 10.0 → **Healthcare 12.0** (Adequate comprehensive care)
- **Optimal**: Hospital 3.0 + Clinic 20.0 → **Healthcare 23.0** (Complete medical infrastructure)

**Important Change**: Hospitals and clinics are now **combined into a single "Healthcare" category** for more realistic medical care assessment. This recognizes that both hospitals and clinics provide essential medical services that should be evaluated together.

**Justification**: 
- **Comprehensive Care**: Patients need access to both primary care (clinics) and specialized/emergency care (hospitals)
- **Realistic Assessment**: Separating hospitals and clinics artificially divided medical infrastructure
- **Urban Planning Reality**: City planners consider total healthcare capacity, not just individual facility types
- **Better User Experience**: Single healthcare score is easier to interpret than separate hospital/clinic ratios

### 👮 **Police Stations**
**Previous vs Updated (per 10,000 people):**
- **Critical**: 0.3 → **0.5** (1 per 100,000+ people - minimal coverage)
- **Warning**: 0.8 → **1.0** (1 per 50,000 people - adequate coverage)
- **Optimal**: 1.5 → **2.0** (1 per 25,000 people - excellent response capability)

**Justification**: Urban areas require more police coverage due to density, crime patterns, and response time requirements.

### 🚒 **Fire Stations**
**Previous vs Updated (per 10,000 people):**
- **Critical**: 0.2 → **0.5** (1 per 20,000 people - too far for emergency response)
- **Warning**: 0.5 → **1.0** (1 per 10,000 people - meets basic standards)
- **Optimal**: 1.0 → **1.5** (1 per 7,000 people - optimal emergency response time)

**Justification**: Fire stations must provide 4-6 minute response times. Higher density requires more stations to meet this critical requirement.

### 🌳 **Parks**
**Previous vs Updated (per 10,000 people):**
- **Critical**: 2.0 → **5.0** (1 per 10,000 people - minimal green space access)
- **Warning**: 5.0 → **10.0** (1 per 5,000 people - reasonable recreation access)
- **Optimal**: 10.0 → **16.7** (1 per 3,000 people - excellent variety and access)

**Justification**: Parks support public health, air quality, and quality of life. Higher density areas need more distributed green spaces.

## Evidence Base

### International Standards Referenced:
- **WHO**: Hospital bed ratios and healthcare accessibility
- **UN-Habitat**: Urban service provision guidelines
- **NFPA**: Fire department deployment standards
- **Urban Planning Institutes**: Police service area standards
- **Parks & Recreation Associations**: Green space accessibility standards

### Key Principles Applied:
1. **Response Time Requirements**: Emergency services need closer spacing in dense areas
2. **Accessibility**: Essential services should be within walking/short travel distance
3. **Redundancy**: Urban areas need backup capacity for resilience
4. **Quality of Life**: Recreation and health services enhance livability

## Real-World Examples

### Example: 500,000 Person Metropolitan Area

| Service | Critical Level | Warning Level | Optimal Level |
|---------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| **Healthcare** | 385 facilities | 600 facilities | 1,150+ facilities |
| **Police Stations** | 25 stations | 50 stations | 100 stations |
| **Fire Stations** | 25 stations | 50 stations | 75 stations |
| **Parks** | 250 parks | 500 parks | 835 parks |

*Healthcare includes all hospitals, clinics, and doctors' offices combined*

### Risk Assessment Messages

The updated system provides more informative feedback:

#### Before (Separate Hospital/Clinic):
> "Insufficient coverage with only 0.8 hospitals per 10,000 people"  
> "Adequate coverage with 5.2 clinics per 10,000 people"

#### After (Combined Healthcare):
> "Critical shortage: only 6.0 healthcare facilities per 10,000 people (below minimum urban planning standards)"

#### Before:
> "Excellent coverage with 15.2 parks per 10,000 people"

#### After:
> "Excellent coverage: 15.2 parks per 10,000 people (meets safe urban planning standards)"

## Risk Level Definitions

### 🟢 **Optimal (Safe)**
- **Meaning**: Meets or exceeds professional urban planning standards
- **Implication**: Excellent service provision with good resilience
- **Action**: Maintain current levels, consider service quality improvements

### 🟡 **Warning (Medium)**
- **Meaning**: Meets minimum standards but has room for improvement
- **Implication**: Adequate service but vulnerable to increased demand
- **Action**: Plan for expansion, monitor service quality

### 🔴 **Critical**
